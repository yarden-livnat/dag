Working with external files (css, js)
and manipulating the dom

* ex2_1: move css to an external file
* ex2_2: add node to the DOM 
* ex2_3: add node to the list // bug
* ex2_4: use onload
* ex2_5: or place script after the dom
* ex2_6: move js to a file  (css doesn't apply because now it's an li)
* ex2_7: include two files (from index.html)
